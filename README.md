The total title of this project is <b>"Deanonymizing quietly all of Tor, the undisclosed attack"</b>

Where one of the two names of ``undisclosed`` is Chameleon because the attack can take various forms

It allows to deanonymize Tor users, hidden services and their operators, the attack is quiet, difficult to detect, easy to perform but subtle, so far we did not find any convincing counter measures against it

It was not intentional to end up with those findings who just came from our work on the [node-Tor](https://github.com/Ayms/node-Tor) project, in fact mistakes raising some concerns

That's not theoretical/academic work and has been tested, showing also some other vectors of attack, this project is for sale, contact: PGP Key fingerprint (aymeric peersm com): 65EF AE3D 973F D36A AB25 1225 2A1D 7B34 2627 AC39
